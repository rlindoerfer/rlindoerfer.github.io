Actually he is an Ex-Detective, but he is still working on murder cases. His hints and guesses often help the San Francisco Police Department to solve the
hardest murder cases. However he suffers from several phobias which makes

spiders, nature in general and many more things. Fortunately his assistant
Natalie Teeger accompanies him and helps him to deal with his fears.
